# Material 5 Responsive Sidenav starter

A small project I created to allow me and others to quickly jump into a project without trying to deal with setting up a responsive layout and/or attractive layout. Adds a responsive element for sidenav that will update depending on the size of the users screen.

## Preview
Here is the layout on a standard screen size, the mode of the sidebar is currently 'push' meaning it will push out the main content:

After it falls below 800px in width the mode changes to 'over' and will render over when open like so:



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
